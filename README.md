# 🧩 Jenkins Local

**Local Jenkins Repository for Development Projects**

This repository provides a **fully isolated local Jenkins environment** for building, testing, and deploying personal or client projects.  
It is designed for developers who prefer running Jenkins locally, without relying on remote servers.

---

## 🛠 Features
- Simple Docker Compose setup (`jenkins/jenkins:alpine`)
- Persistent data storage via bind-mount (`/srv/jenkins`)
- Direct Docker integration using `/var/run/docker.sock`
- Optimized for local CI/CD pipelines and Laravel / PHP projects

---

## 💻 Usage

Start Jenkins locally:
```bash
docker compose up -d 
make jenkins-permissions
```
## 🌐 Access Jenkins in your browser:

👉 [http://localhost:8089](http://localhost:8089)

## 🛑 Stop Jenkins:
```bash
docker compose down
```
## 📂 Purpose

This project keeps Jenkins **independent from main development stacks**,  
allowing you to safely test and manage **CI/CD pipelines for local environments**  
without affecting your main applications or Docker networks.
